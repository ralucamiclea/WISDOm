Short description
We will write a 3D world which you can explore in first-person view (and maybe interact with some parts of it).

Will-do features
Gravity (the camera needs to stick to the floor)
Textured objects, floor, etc
Skybox
Jump animation
Small and simple particle effects when visiting a checkpoint
Simple collision detection (and prevention) with the objects from the world
Simple HUD & mini map 
Goal of the game: Visit every checkpoint! -> surprise when all checkpoints have been visited

Might-do features
Sound
Environmental mapping
Objects reacting to the presence of the “explorer” (they move or explode or change their shape, make a sound etc)
Fire
Rain
The “explorer” being able to fly into the world
